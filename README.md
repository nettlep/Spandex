# Legacy Code Resurrection Project

This file is part of a glorious rescue mission: migrating ancient code from the dusty vaults of the internet to the shiny halls of GitHub.

This code has been preserved as faithfully as possible, warts and all. All code contained herein is original code written by Paul Nettle unless otherwise noted.

## Original description

Please note that emails and web pages are no longer valid.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is Project Spandex v1.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Spandex is a 3D engine, written for portability and quality above speed
    (although speed is a very close runner-up! :)

    The idea behind Spandex is that it is an internet-wide project.  It's up
    to YOU to contribute.  So DO IT!

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You'll need to copy the EXE's from the TOOLS directory to someplace in
    your path (or point your path at that directory).

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This engine is maintained at www.grafix3d.dyn.ml.org.  Any modifications
    changes, additions, etc. should be made available there to the webmaster
    (MidNight).

    If you make any modifications to the source code, please document your
    changes well (your comments may be the only comments in the code. :)

    See the todo.txt file for a list of things that are on the current wish
    list.

    See the legal.txt file for that legal stuff.

    To use spandex, you'll first need to build it.  Do so in the source dir-
    ectory (there's a short readme.txt file there).

    Documentation is in the DOCS directory.  The master version is currently
    only available in MS Word 7.0 format (you can get a free viewer from
    Microsoft or on the www.grafix3d.dyn.ml.org web page).  But there are
    other formats there, too.

## Why preserve this?

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.

Happy coding!
