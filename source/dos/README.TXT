This is Project Spandex v1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spandex is a 3D engine, written for portability and quality above speed
(although speed is a very close runner-up! :)

The idea behind Spandex is that it is an internet-wide project.  It's up
to YOU to contribute.  So DO IT!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll need to copy the EXE's from the TOOLS directory to someplace in
your path (or point your path at that directory).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This engine is maintained at www.grafix3d.dyn.ml.org.  Any modifications
changes, additions, etc. should be made available there to the webmaster
(MidNight).

If you make any modifications to the source code, please document your
changes well (your comments may be the only comments in the code. :)

See the todo.txt file for a list of things that are on the current wish
list.

See the legal.txt file for that legal stuff.

To use spandex, you'll first need to build it.  Do so in the source dir-
ectory (there's a short readme.txt file there).

Documentation is in the DOCS directory.  The master version is currently
only available in MS Word 7.0 format (you can get a free viewer from
Microsoft or on the www.grafix3d.dyn.ml.org web page).  But there are
other formats there, too.
